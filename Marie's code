# This is a sample Python script.
# Press Shift+F10 to execute it or replace it with your code.

#Step 1 To get pandas in my IDE
#Click on the globe icon and click on install and import pandas or below may work for u
#python3 get-pip.py
#pip3 install pandas

#Step 2 Either work from my python working directory or copy path manually
# using code code to get the working directory path and then paste this in your file directory
# paste the file in this directory on your desktop
#import os
#path = os.getcwd()
#print(path)    #result  C:\Users\Marie\PycharmProjects\pythonProject\Datacamp_Python

#2b other leave the files where they are and simply copy the path and use in your code
# To copy path, type in the filename in windows in search bar and then click on copy file path
#e.g for government saved on downloads #C:\Users\Marie\Downloads\Goverment_csv.csv


#Step 3 To Read The Json Goverment Dataset
#step 3a
#import json
#from urllib.request import urlopen
#with urlopen("https://www.gov.uk/api/organisations") as res:
#    source = res.read()
#    print(source)

#3b To Load the file into a python object
#import json
#from urllib.request import urlopen
#with urlopen("https://www.gov.uk/api/organisations") as res:
#    source = res.read()
#data = json.loads(source)
#print(data)  # everthing is spat out in one line

#to dump the contents of the file in a python string, e.g after deleting some columns etc
#print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))     # To mamke it more readable
#print(type(data))    # Answer  <class 'dict'>
#print(data.shape)    # error, can't perform shape, attribute on a dictionary type
#print(len(data['results']))  # 20lines counted
#print(type(data['results']))  # <class 'list'>

#Disecting the data more
#for item in data['results']:
  #  print(item)

    #id = item['id']
    #print(id)

    #title = item['title']
    #print(title)

    #slug = item['details']['slug']
    #print(slug)

   #still_open = item['details']['closed_at']
   # print(still_open)
   # print(str(title) + "     " + " ------ " + "     " + str(still_open))
   # print(id, title)

#Step 3c To load a Json string into a python Object
#does not work because this a json file and not json string that I have typed into python
#import json
#df = json.load('Goverment.json')
#for data in df['results']:
#    print(data['title'])
#    del data['title']    # to delete entire column and it's values



# Step 4 Trying to Load CSV files
#4a for schools csv
#import csv
#with open('schools.csv', 'r') as sch:
#    sch_res = csv.reader(sch)
    #print(sch_res)   #just prints out object name

    #for line in sch_res:
    #    print(line)

# 4b companies.csv file
#import csv
#with open('companies.csv', 'r') as comp:
 #   comp_res = csv.reader(comp)
 #   #print(comp_res)   #just prints out object name
 #   for linec in comp_res:
 #       print(linec)


#Step 5 Text Files i.e charity
#with open('Charity.txt', 'r') as f:
#    Text_file = f.readline()
#    print(Text_file)
#    Text_file = f.readline()
#    print(Text_file)
#    Text_file = f.readline()
#    print(Text_file)
#    Text_file = f.readline()
#    print(Text_file)

#    Text_file = f.readlines()  #it is not reading all lines at once
#    print(Text_file)


#ignore not tried yet, would probably merge as csv
#Join 2 Text files
#create a file with a name you chose for the file name to store both text files in.
#you will enter 3 information into terminal when promted, filename 1, 2 and 3rd filename which is an empty file to store both in
#import shutil
#file1 = input("Enter the name of the file1: ")
#file2 = input("Enter the name of the file2: ")
#Destination = input("Enter the destination filename: ")
#with open(Destination, "wb")  as wfd:
   # for files in (file1,file2):
  #      with open(files, "rb") as fd:
 #           shutil.copyfileobj(fd,wfd)
#chek = open(Destination, "r")
#print(chek.read())
#chek.close()
